Hi :wave: ! My name is William Cheng and I am a senior undergraduate Computer Science student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am research student at [ParkLabML](https://parklabml.github.io/), supervised by Dr. Mi Jung Park, looking at evaluating and extending reconstruction attacks for machine unlearning algorithmns.

I also have experience working in the tech as a full-stack software engineer and as a software automation engineer/developer. I took a 8 month co-op at [Planview (Previously Tasktop Technologies)](https://www.planview.com/) as a Software Engineer, 8 months as a Software Automation Engineer at [Delta-Q Technologies](https://delta-q.com/), and a 4 month Software Testing role at [Rentrax](https://rentrax.com/). I am experienced with technologies such as PyTorch, NumPy, SciKitLearn, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Spring Framework, Apache Kafka etc.

My current research interests include machine learning theory and applications, including privacy for computer vision, LLMs, multi-model etc. I am also interested in machine unlearning, which is the process to make models forget deleted data. This research is important because it both protects users from privacy attacks, leakage of confidential information, and copyright infringements. Currently, there is policy _Right To Be Forgotten_ in place in many countries.

You can view my resume/CV for more information.

Thanks for stopping by!
